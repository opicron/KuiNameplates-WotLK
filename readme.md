# KuiNameplates WoTLK

Shoutout to Somewierdhuman for his [Awesome_Wotlk](https://github.com/someweirdhuman/awesome_wotlk) patch! This is a modded version of his modded Kui Nameplates addon.

* Added elite skulls and text (Level option needs to be enabled, default)
* Added chat bubbles
* Changed NameOnly module to hide neutral healthbars
* Fade Auras when FadeName is used (and out of combat)

Original addon highlights:

* Auras work correctly on all nameplates
* Castbars on all nameplates(!)
* Faster/reliant code for nameplates (due to Awesome Wotlk patch)
